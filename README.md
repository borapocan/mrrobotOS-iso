MrRobotOS is a fully custom Arch Linux-based operating system built from the ground up — not configured, not themed, **written**. Every component from the display manager to the status bar is original code, designed around a singular philosophy: total control, zero compromise, and an aesthetic that belongs to no one but itself.

This is not a rice. This is not a dotfiles collection. This is an operating system.

---

## Roadmap

### Coming Soon — Cloud & Storage Integration

- **Cloud integration** — manage VMs, containers, remote services and databases directly from the MrRobotOS desktop
- **Storage replication** — built-in replication across local and remote targets, designed for Proxmox and VMware backends
- **Distributed storage** — redundancy and high availability across nodes
- **Backup and snapshot management** — scheduled snapshots and offsite backup from the desktop environment

> The goal is a desktop that is not just an interface to your local machine, but a control plane for your entire infrastructure — from your room to your rack.

## Why MrRobotOS Instead of KDE, GNOME, or Any Other Fat Desktop

Modern desktop environments are architecturally obese. KDE ships with hundreds of megabytes of Qt libraries, plasma frameworks, and services that run whether you need them or not. GNOME requires GNOME Shell, Mutter, dozens of background daemons, and a JavaScript engine embedded in the compositor just to render a panel. Their ISOs exceed 2–4 GB. Their idle RAM usage starts at 600 MB to 1.5 GB before you open a single application.

MrRobotOS does everything they do — window management, status bar, settings GUI, process manager, display manager, quick settings panel, notifications, compositor, launcher, terminal emulator — and does it in a fraction of the space, starting under 200 MB idle RAM.

The difference is not features. The difference is that every component in MrRobotOS was written to do exactly one thing, and nothing else. No plugin systems. No DBus activation for things that don't need it. No JavaScript interpreters embedded in the compositor. No abstract framework layers between the code and the hardware.

KDE and GNOME are platforms. MrRobotOS is a machine.

| | MrRobotOS | GNOME | KDE Plasma |
|---|---|---|---|
| Idle RAM | ~180 MB | ~1.0–1.5 GB | ~1.5–2.8 GB |
| ISO size | ~1.6 GB | ~2.5 GB | ~2.8 GB |
| Installed disk (minimal) | ~2–3 GB | ~4.2 GB | ~5–7 GB |
| Installed disk (full) | ~3–4 GB | ~4.2+ GB | ~10–20 GB |
| Display manager | mrlogin (custom C) | GDM | SDDM |
| Window manager | mrdwm (custom C) | Mutter + JS shell | KWin (Qt/C++) |
| Status bar | mrblocks (custom C) | GNOME Shell | Plasmashell |
| Settings app | mrsettings (GTK4 C) | Control Center | System Settings |
| Terminal emulator | mrst (custom C) | GNOME Terminal | Konsole |
| Boot to desktop | Fast | Slow | Slow |
| Fully hackable | Yes — read the source | Barely | Somewhat |

> KDE minimal = plasma-desktop only. KDE full = plasma-meta + kde-applications-meta (~6–9 GB). GNOME full installation footprint ~4.2 GB.

## Components

### mrlogin — Display Manager

A fully custom X11 display manager written in C using Xlib and Xft. No LightDM, no GDM — mrlogin owns the screen from the moment the system boots.

**Features:**
- Full-screen login UI with live clock updated every second and an animated dot grid background
- Multi-user support with clickable avatar cards and Tab-key switching
- PAM authentication via `pam_start`, `pam_authenticate`, `pam_acct_mgmt`
- Progressive lockout: 1 minute → 5 minutes → 15 minutes → 1 hour → permanent device disable
- Visual attempt tracker rendered as colored arc dots — one dot fills red per failed attempt
- Password visibility toggle with Font Awesome eye / eye-slash icon
- Cursor-aware hover detection: pointer changes to hand on all interactive elements
- Rounded card UI with accent header bar, drop shadow, and inline error messaging
- Launches user session via `dbus-run-session` under a zsh login shell sourcing `~/.xinitrc`
- Full environment setup: `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` creation with correct ownership, `initgroups`, `setuid`, `setgid`, `chdir`
- Primary monitor detection via `xrandr` for correct geometry on multi-monitor setups

---

### mrdwm — Window Manager

A heavily patched and deeply extended fork of [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/), pushed far beyond the patch ecosystem into original territory. Written in C against Xlib and XCB.

**Layout Engine:**
Tile, Monocle, Deck, Grid, Fibonacci Spiral, Fibonacci Dwindle, Centered Master, Centered Floating Master, Three-Column (TCL). Adjustable gaps with per-monitor state. Master/stack ratio and master count control.

**Bar:**
- Per-client tabbed title area with proportional width distribution and pixel-accurate remainder handling
- Window icons rendered via `_NET_WM_ICON` with Imlib2 rescaling and XRender compositing
- Hover highlighting on title tabs — focus follows mouse over the bar
- Nine color schemes: Normal, Selected, Hover, Hidden, Status, Tags Selected, Tags Normal, Info Selected, Info Normal
- Status text with clickable signal routing to mrblocks via `SIGRTMIN+N`
- Configurable vertical padding, side padding, and per-monitor bar geometry

**Tag Preview System:**
- Hover over any tag to get a live scaled screenshot preview of its contents using Imlib2
- Full window overview triggered via SIGUSR1: captures all client windows using XRender compositing, scales them into a responsive grid, and overlays them as a selectable switcher
- Grid layout adapts to window count — 1 window gets 80% of screen, 2 windows side by side, 3+ arranged in computed rows and columns with configurable gaps
- Click any preview to jump to that window's tag; keyboard press or right-click to dismiss without switching
- Panel-aware: panels are raised above the preview overlay and excluded from the capture grid
- Stale previews are freed when tags become unoccupied

**Window Management:**
- Window swallowing: a terminal spawning a GUI app disappears and the GUI takes its visual place, restoring the terminal on close
- Per-window show/hide using `IconicState` — works as per-window scratchpads
- Panel detection by window name: zero borders, pinned to bottom, always visible across all tags
- Urgent hint propagation, EWMH compliance: fullscreen, active window, window type, client list

**Multi-monitor:**
Full Xinerama support with unique geometry deduplication. Per-monitor independent tag sets, layout state, and bar position. Focus follows mouse across monitor boundaries.

---

### mrblocks — Status Bar Daemon

A from-scratch status bar block runner written in C. Not a shell script scheduler — a proper event-driven daemon with `poll`, `signalfd`, and pipe-based IPC.

**Architecture:**
- Each block forks a subprocess connected via a dedicated pipe pair
- `poll`-based watcher monitors all block read-ends and the signal file descriptor simultaneously with no busy waiting
- Timer computed as GCD of all block intervals, minimizing `SIGALRM` firings
- `signalfd` handles `SIGALRM`, `SIGRTMIN+N`, `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, and `REFRESH_SIGNAL` in a unified read loop
- No zombie processes: `waitpid` called after every block read
- UTF-8 aware output truncation per block
- Status string written to X root window name via XCB only when content changes

**Active Blocks:**

| Script | Signal | Function |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `sb-datetime` | SIGRTMIN+1 | Date and time with Nerd Font clock icon |
| `sb-wifi` | SIGRTMIN+2 | Wi-Fi signal strength with 4-level Nerd Font icons, ethernet, VPN |
| `sb-bluetooth` | SIGRTMIN+3 | Bluetooth power state and connected device name |
| `sb-volume` | SIGRTMIN+4 | PulseAudio volume with 4-state icons, scroll to adjust, middle to mute |

---

### mrst — Terminal Emulator

A heavily patched fork of [st](https://st.suckless.org/) extended with scrollback history, improved rendering, and mrdwm window swallowing integration. Written in C against Xlib.

**Features:**
- 2000-line scrollback history ring buffer with `kscrollup` / `kscrolldown` keybindings
- History-aware line rendering via `TLINE(y)` macro that reads from the ring buffer when scrolled back
- Selection coordinates adjusted during scroll via `selscroll` — selection survives scrolling
- `tscrollup` / `tscrolldown` extended with `copyhist` parameter controlling whether lines enter the history ring
- XRender-based window surface capture for mrdwm preview system: `getwindowximage` composites the terminal with alpha blending via `XRenderComposite`, then scales via `scaleimagetofit` using nearest-neighbor pixel mapping
- Full UTF-8 decode/encode pipeline with surrogate pair rejection and replacement character fallback
- VT100 graphic character translation table: box drawing, arrows, symbols
- Complete CSI, OSC, DCS, APC, PM escape sequence handling

---

### mrpanel — Taskbar and Desktop Shell

A custom XFCE4 panel configuration serving as the bottom taskbar and desktop control surface, extended with over 30 original genmon scripts that transform it into a complete desktop shell.

**Window Overview and Application Launcher:**
The panel includes a GNOME Activities / xfdashboard-style window overview and application launcher. A single button triggers a full-screen overlay showing all open windows as live scaled thumbnails — powered by mrdwm's SIGUSR1 preview capture system — combined with an application grid for launching new apps. Task switching and app launching unified in one gesture, without GNOME Shell, without Mutter, without JavaScript.

**Genmon Panel Scripts:**

| Script | Function |
|--------|----------|
| `datetime-panel.sh` | Clock and date with click-to-calendar |
| `datetime.sh` | Compact time format |
| `battery-panel.sh` | Battery with charging state icons |

## Philosophy

MrRobotOS exists at the intersection of two truths: that a computer is a machine, and that machines can be owned completely. Every line in this repository was written with the understanding that abstraction is a choice — and that choosing to go deeper is always available to those willing to read the source.

The aesthetic is intentional. The Mr. Robot theme is not decoration. It is a reminder that the systems we interact with every day are not fixed — they are written by people, and they can be rewritten.

This is one person's complete vision of what a desktop operating system should be: minimal in dependency, maximal in control, and honest about every decision it makes.
